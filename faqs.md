## What happened to mybluemix.net?
{: #domain-change-faq}
{: faq}

A new host name option `*.appdomain.cloud` is available on cloud.ibm.com.

Previously, the `mybluemix.net` domain was used for hosting applications in various deployment targets, such as {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} or Cloud Foundry. Any apps that are hosted on `mybluemix.net` are not impacted.

The subdomain for Cloud Foundry apps is `cf.appdomain.cloud`. The subdomain for apps that you deploy to {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} is `containers.appdomain.cloud`.

For more information, see [Managing your domains](/docs/apps?topic=apps-update-domain).

## Where can I find a list of my apps?
{: #cf-app}
{: faq}

The Resource list in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}){: external} provides summary information for the apps that you created. From the [Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources), the **Apps** section contains all apps that you created but *not* deployed to Cloud Foundry. The **Cloud Foundry Apps** section contains all the apps that you created and deployed to Cloud Foundry.

## Why canâ€™t I select a Cloud Foundry space when I try to deploy an app?
{: #cf-space}
{: faq}

You most likely need to create a Cloud Foundry space first. If you are using the Cloud Foundry command-line interface, type `cf create-space <space_name> -o <organization_name>`. Otherwise, complete these steps:

1. From the menu bar in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}){: external}, select **Manage** > **Account**.
2. Select **Cloud Foundry orgs**.
3. Click the name of the organization that you want to create a space in, and click **Add a space**.

## How do I delete apps?
{: #delete-apps}
{: faq}

To delete an app that you created, complete these steps:

1. From the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}){: external}, click the **Menu** icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **Resource list**.
2. Click the **Actions** icon ![Actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) for the app that you want to delete, and click **Delete**.

## How do I stop a Cloud Foundry app?
{: #app-stop}
{: faq}

If you want to stop a Cloud Foundry app, complete the following steps:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **View resources** within the Resources summary section.
1. On the Resource list page, expand the sections, and locate the service instance that you want to stop.
1. Select the **Actions** ![List of actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) menu, and then click **Stop**.

## What are toolchains?
{: #toolchains}
{: faq}

A toolchain is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks. You can create a toolchain from your app. The toolchain can support continuous development, deployment, monitoring, and more, and it is associated with your app. Each app can be associated with a toolchain. A toolchain can be configured so that changes to the toolchain automatically build and deploy the app. For more information about toolchains, see [Creating toolchains](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started).

## How do I extract a toolchain template from an existing toolchain?
{: #toolchain-template}
{: faq}

You can run the [toolchain-to-template script](https://github.com/open-toolchain/toolchain-to-template#setup) to extract a toolchain template from an existing toolchain. This script uses a toolchain URL and generates an open toolchain (OTC) template in the current folder. When the script runs, it creates a clone of your original toolchain.

## How do I change the domain for Cloud Foundry apps?
{: #cf-domains-faq}
{: faq}

For Cloud Foundry apps, you can change your domain from `mybluemix.net` to `appdomain.cloud` by using either the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the command-line interface. For more information about changing your domain to `appdomain.cloud`, see [Updating your domain](/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-update-domain).

When you create new apps, the default shared domain is `mybluemix.net`, but `appdomain.cloud` is another domain option that you can use.
